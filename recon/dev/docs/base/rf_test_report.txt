Operating Modes and Conditions

The EUT was programmed by the manufacturer to allow test mode control using a Direct Test Mode
software application from Nordic Semiconductor. The conducted and radiated test mode samples were
configured with 12-pin headers for radio control and were powered using USB C cables and AC Power
Adapters supplied by the client. Low, middle and high Bluetooth LE channels were tested using the
same modulation and bandwidth as is used in normal operation. PRBS9 packet data was used with the
packet length set to 37 bytes, which produced the highest available duty cycle. A Power setting of 4dBm was used for all tests.

RSS-247 S5.4 (d)

Compliant

Test Method

Fundamental maximum conducted (average) output power measurements were performed using the
method described in ANSI C63.10:2013 clause 11.9.2.3.2. This method uses a wideband gated RF
power meter with gate parameters adjusted such that the power is measured only when the EUT is
transmitting at its maximum power control level. Because the measurement is made only during the ON
time of the transmitter, no duty cycle correction factor is required. This procedure is referenced in KDB
558074 D01 15.247 Meas Guidance v05r02. See section 2.5 above for test setup diagram.
Limit
For systems using digital modulation in the 902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz, and 5725-5850 MHz
bands: 1 Watt. For using antennas with greater than 6dBi of gain, the limit is reduced in dB by the
amount the gain exceeds 6dBi (e.g. for a 7.4dBi antenna, the limit is reduced from 30dBm to 28.6dBm).
Also, the e.i.r.p. shall not exceed 4 Watts (36 dBm) based on RSS-247 S5.4 (d).

Test Method

Radiated emissions in restricted frequency bands were measured using methods defined in ANSI
C63.10 clause 11.12. These procedures are referenced in KDB 558074 D01 15.247 Meas Guidance
v05r02.
Lowest, middle and highest channels were investigated – the device was commanded to continuously
transmit on channels 0, 19 and 39.
Below are the test setup diagrams used in this testing.

Test distances for radiated tests:
9k to 30 MHz – Near field prescan to determine if there were any emissions
30 to 1000 MHz - The EUT to measurement antenna distance was 3 meters
1 to 18 GHz - The EUT to measurement antenna distance was 3 meters
18 to 26 GHz - The EUT to measurement antenna distance was 3 meters

Test Method

Field strength measurements were performed at the restricted band edges of 2390MHz and 2483.5MHz.
Measurements were made using the conducted methods defined in ANSI C63.10: 2013 clause 11.12.2.
The measurements were converted to a radiated field strength equivalent using the equations defined in
that section. Both peak and average measurements were performed at the antenna port. These
procedures are referenced in KDB 558074 D01 15.247 Meas Guidance v05r02. See section 2.5 above
for test setup diagram.
Offset Calculations:
A reference level offset was applied to the spectrum analyzer so that conducted measurements in dBµV
represent field strength measurements in dBµV/m.
Offset = -20Log(D) + 104.8 - 107 + CL + DC + AG
Offset3m = -11.7 + CL + DC + AG
Where:
D = 3m
CL = 0.73 dB
DC = 1.9 dB (64.8%)
AG = 2 dB

9 Measurement Uncertainty
The measurement uncertainty figures are calculated in accordance with TR 100 028-1 [2] and
correspond to an expansion factor (coverage factor) k = 2 (which provides confidence levels of 95.45 %
in the case where the distributions characterizing the actual measurement uncertainties are normal
(Gaussian)).
